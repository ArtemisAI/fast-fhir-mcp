# FHIR-MCP Integration Roadmap
## Healthcare Data Interoperability with CarePulse EMR

### Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the strategic transformation of the CarePulse EMR system from a traditional healthcare application to a FHIR-compliant, interoperable healthcare platform using Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. The goal is to demonstrate how modern healthcare applications can achieve seamless data exchange while maintaining security, performance, and user experience.

## Current State Analysis

### CarePulse EMR Architecture (As-Is)
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Appwrite BaaS
- **Data Storage**: Custom Appwrite collections
- **Data Models**: Non-FHIR compliant TypeScript interfaces
- **Authentication**: Appwrite auth system
- **Interoperability**: None (isolated system)
- **Standards Compliance**: Basic healthcare workflows, no FHIR compliance

### Key Strengths to Preserve
- ✅ Modern React/Next.js architecture
- ✅ Strong TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Robust form validation with Zod
- ✅ Professional healthcare UI/UX
- ✅ Real-time capabilities
- ✅ File upload and document management

### Critical Gaps
- ❌ No FHIR resource compliance
- ❌ Limited healthcare interoperability
- ❌ Missing clinical terminologies (SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC)
- ❌ Non-standard API patterns
- ❌ Isolated data architecture

## Strategic Vision

### Target Architecture (To-Be)
```
Frontend (Next.js) ↔ FHIR MCP Gateway ↔ FHIR Server ↔ Healthcare Ecosystem
                                     ↕
