1. The Research Problem
The digital transformation of healthcare has led to the widespread adoption of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which provides a robust, API-centric approach to representing and exchanging electronic health records. Concurrently, the field of Artificial Intelligence has witnessed the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), which exhibit unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and complex reasoning.
Despite the parallel advancements in these two domains, a significant semantic and technical gap persists. FHIR offers structured, machine-readable data via RESTful APIs, while LLMs operate through a more fluid, conversational, and increasingly tool-driven paradigm. Integrating these two ecosystems currently requires bespoke, ad-hoc engineering solutions that are brittle, non-standardized, and difficult to reproduce. This "impedance mismatch" creates a critical barrier, preventing the full potential of advanced AI from being applied to standardized health data repositories. Consequently, researchers in fields like pharmaceuticals and clinical informatics are unable to leverage these powerful AI models for complex tasks like cohort discovery or real-world evidence analysis in a scalable and standardized manner.
2. Main Objective and Research Question
The primary objective of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate a novel, open-source framework that bridges the gap between FHIR-based health information systems and agentic Large Language Models.
This framework will be architected around the Motor Context Protocol (MCP), a standard designed for AI agents to interact with tools and external systems. By implementing MCP as an intelligent middleware, this research aims to create a standardized, reproducible pathway for LLMs to autonomously interact with healthcare data.
This leads to the central research question:
> How can a standardized agent-tool protocol like MCP be leveraged to enable Large Language Models to autonomously and reliably perform complex query and analysis tasks on a standard FHIR data repository?

3. Justification and Significance of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses a pressing challenge at the confluence of health informatics and artificial intelligence. Its contribution is threefold:
 * Contribution to Health Informatics: This work aims to democratize the use of sophisticated AI on standardized health data. By creating a standardized bridge, the framework will lower the barrier to entry for developing next-generation clinical decision support systems, automated data analysis tools, and intelligent health information retrieval systems. It moves the paradigm from simple data fetching to intelligent, contextual data interaction.
 * Contribution to Pharmaceutical Research: The proposed framework has direct applications in the pharmaceutical industry. It can significantly accelerate critical, data-intensive tasks such as:
   * Clinical Trial Cohort Selection: Allowing researchers to conversationally define complex inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., "Find all female patients over 50 with a history of hypertension but no diagnosis of kidney disease").
   * Pharmacovigilance: Enabling the automated analysis of patient records to identify potential adverse drug events.
   * Real-World Evidence (RWE) Studies: Facilitating the rapid exploration and analysis of large, real-world datasets to understand treatment patterns and outcomes.
 * Contribution to AI and Computer Science: The project provides a crucial, real-world testbed for evaluating the agentic capabilities of LLMs. Interacting with a highly structured, strictly-defined, and domain-specific API like FHIR presents a unique challenge for LLM tool-use. The findings will provide valuable insights into the reliability, limitations, and reasoning capabilities of current AI agents, contributing to the broader field of AI safety and tool-augmented intelligence. Furthermore, by delivering a fully open-source artifact, this research promotes transparency and reproducibility, allowing the wider academic community to build upon its findings.
4. Core Hypothesis
It is hypothesized that a framework mediating between an LLM and a FHIR API via the Motor Context Protocol will significantly reduce the engineering complexity of developing AI-driven health data applications. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that this architecture will enable an LLM to perform data retrieval and analysis tasks with a higher degree of autonomy and accuracy compared to direct, non-agentic API integration methods, thereby unlocking new possibilities for AI in healthcare.
