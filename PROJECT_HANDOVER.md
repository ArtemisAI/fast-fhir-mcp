# Project Handover - FHIR-MCP Integration

**Handover Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Repository**: `Daniel-Gonzalez-AI/fhir-mcp`  
**Status**: DEBUGGING PHASE - Ready for Takeover  

## Project Overview

### Objective
Gradually upload 114 EMR (Electronic Medical Record) files to GitHub repository with controlled intervals to avoid overwhelming the system and maintain compliance with academic submission requirements.

### Scope
- **Source**: Local EMR NextJS project files
- **Destination**: Private GitHub repository `Daniel-Gonzalez-AI/fhir-mcp`
- **Method**: Automated PowerShell script with state persistence
- **Timeline**: 20-minute intervals between commits (~38 hours total)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Items
1. **Repository Setup**: Private GitHub repo created and configured
2. **Script Development**: Four iterations of PowerShell scripts developed
3. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing on subsets completed
4. **Documentation**: Full documentation and issue tracking implemented
5. **Compatibility**: PowerShell Core compatibility resolved

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Active Issues
1. **Git Working Tree Management**: Critical blocker preventing production run
2. **Error Recovery**: Needs enhanced handling for commit failures

### üîÑ Ready for Handover
- All code and documentation complete
- Issues fully documented with solutions proposed
- Testing procedures established
- Ready for experienced PowerShell/Git developer

## Technical Architecture

### Core Script: `gradual-commit-v4.ps1`
**Location**: `.scripts/gradual-commit-v4.ps1`  
**Status**: Functional for dry runs, needs git error handling fix  

#### Key Features
- **State Persistence**: JSON-based resume capability
- **File Prioritization**: Intelligent ordering (config files first)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time console output with progress bars
- **Error Handling**: Basic retry logic (needs enhancement)
- **Safety Features**: Dry-run mode, clean-up procedures

#### Parameters
```powershell
-RepositoryPath    # Git repository root
-EMRPath          # Relative path to EMR files  
-TargetFolder     # Optional: specific subfolder
-Branch           # Git branch (default: main)
-IntervalMinutes  # Wait time between commits
-DryRun          # Simulation mode
-Resume          # Continue from saved state
-Force           # Continue after failures
```

### File Processing Logic
1. **Discovery**: Recursively scan EMR folder (114 files found)
2. **Filtering**: Exclude gitignored files (node_modules, .env, etc.)
3. **Prioritization**: Config files ‚Üí TypeScript ‚Üí JS ‚Üí CSS ‚Üí Docs ‚Üí Others
4. **Commits**: Individual commits with descriptive messages
5. **State Tracking**: Save progress after each successful commit

## Critical Issue Details

### Primary Blocker: Git Working Tree Management
**File**: `issues/git-working-tree-issues.md`  
**Impact**: Prevents production execution  
**Cause**: Script fails when working tree has uncommitted changes  

#### Error Pattern
```
Git commit failed: On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   README.md
Untracked files:
        EMR/.dockerignore
        [... many EMR files ...]
no changes added to commit
```

#### Proposed Solutions
1. **Auto-cleanup function** (recommended)
2. **Alternative git strategy** (temporary branches)
3. **Simplified commands** (remove --only flag)

See detailed analysis in `issues/git-working-tree-issues.md`

## Testing Status

### Successful Tests ‚úÖ
- **v3 Subset Test**: EMR/types folder (2 files) - SUCCESS
- **v4 Dry Run**: All 114 files simulated - SUCCESS  
- **PowerShell Core**: Compatibility verified - SUCCESS

### Failed Tests ‚ùå
- **v4 Production Run**: First commit failed due to dirty working tree
- **Windows PowerShell**: Syntax compatibility issues (resolved: use Core)

### Test Results Location
**File**: `issues/testing-results.md` - Complete test history and logs

## Handover Instructions

### For the Next Developer

#### Prerequisites
1. **PowerShell Core**: Ensure `pwsh.exe` is available
2. **Git Access**: Verify push access to `Daniel-Gonzalez-AI/fhir-mcp`
3. **Time Availability**: Plan for 2-4 hours debugging + 38 hours execution

#### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Read Issues**: Review `issues/git-working-tree-issues.md` thoroughly
2. **Clean Environment**: Ensure `git status` shows clean working tree
3. **Test Subset**: Use `-TargetFolder types` for initial validation
4. **Implement Fix**: Choose and implement one of the proposed solutions

#### Execution Sequence
```powershell
# 1. Environment check
pwsh.exe --version
git status

# 2. Clean working tree
git add . && git commit -m "Clean tree before EMR upload"

# 3. Test with subset (REQUIRED)
pwsh.exe -NoProfile -File ".\.scripts\gradual-commit-v4.ps1" -TargetFolder types -IntervalMinutes 1

# 4. Production run (only after successful test)
pwsh.exe -NoProfile -File ".\.scripts\gradual-commit-v4.ps1" -IntervalMinutes 20
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 114 EMR files committed individually
- [ ] Each commit has descriptive message
- [ ] No repository corruption or merge conflicts
- [ ] State file cleaned up after completion
- [ ] Documentation updated with final results

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Data Loss**: All files are backed up locally
- **Repository Corruption**: Script only adds files, doesn't modify existing
- **Account Issues**: Private repository, academic use only

### Medium Risk
- **Time Overrun**: 38-hour execution window requires planning
- **Network Issues**: Git push failures could interrupt process
- **System Interruption**: Resume capability mitigates this risk

### High Risk
- **Git State Corruption**: Current blocker could cause repository issues
- **Authentication Expiry**: Long execution time might hit token limits

## Resources and Documentation

### Essential Reading Order
1. `EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` - How to run scripts
2. `issues/git-working-tree-issues.md` - Primary problem analysis
3. `issues/testing-results.md` - What's been tested
4. `.scripts/gradual-commit-v4.ps1` - The actual script

### Support Materials
- **PowerShell Documentation**: Focus on git integration patterns
- **Git Documentation**: Specifically `git commit --only` behavior
- **GitHub API**: Backup approach if script fails entirely

## Estimated Completion Timeline

### Debug Phase: 2-4 hours
- Implement git working tree fix
- Test with small subset
- Validate full dry run

### Execution Phase: 38 hours
- Monitor first few commits
- Check in periodically
- Handle any network/auth issues

### Finalization: 1 hour
- Verify all files committed
