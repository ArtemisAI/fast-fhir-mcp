# Project Handover Documentation

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Project**: FHIR-MCP Integration Framework  
**Status**: Development Paused - Critical Issues  
**Repository**: Daniel-Gonzalez-AI/fhir-mcp (private)  

## Project Status Summary

### ✅ Completed Successfully
1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Private repository created: `Daniel-Gonzalez-AI/fhir-mcp`
   - Student account authentication configured
   - Professional README.md and ROADMAP.md added
   - Healthcare-compliant .gitignore patterns

2. **Credential Management** 
   - UdeM student account: `daniel.agustin.gonzalez.zubillaga@umontreal.ca`
   - Separated from work account (ArtemisAI) successfully
   - Local git configuration verified

3. **Script Infrastructure**
   - State persistence system (JSON-based)
   - Resume capability from interruptions
   - Folder-specific targeting
   - Professional commit message formatting
   - Progress tracking and visual feedback

4. **Live Testing Validation**
   - Path resolution issues identified and fixed
   - Authentication working correctly
   - First file upload successful (appwrite.types.ts)
   - State saving and loading functional

### ❌ Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

1. **PowerShell Script Syntax Errors**
   - gradual-commit-v3.ps1: Try-Catch block incomplete (line 304)
   - gradual-commit-v4.ps1: Color parameter binding issues
   - Testing interrupted during EMR\types upload

2. **Incomplete EMR Upload**
   - Target: 114 files total
   - Progress: 1 file committed, 113 remaining
   - Estimated completion time: 38 hours with 20-minute intervals

## Technical Architecture

```

### State Management
- **Current State**: `commit-state-types.json` 
- **Last Success**: appwrite.types.ts committed at 2025-08-13T18:29:45Z
- **Resume Point**: index.d.ts (file 2/2 in types folder)
- **Full State**: Ready for 114-file upload once script fixed

## Immediate Next Steps for Continuation

### Priority 1: Fix Script Syntax (Critical)
1. **Diagnose**: Review `/issues/powershell-script-errors.md`
2. **Fix**: Complete Try-Catch block in gradual-commit-v3.ps1 line 304
3. **Test**: Validate syntax with PowerShell parser
4. **Verify**: Complete EMR\types testing (1 file remaining)

### Priority 2: Complete Testing
1. **Resume**: Use existing state file to continue types folder
2. **Validate**: Ensure second file (index.d.ts) uploads successfully  
3. **Timing**: Verify 5-minute intervals working correctly
4. **State**: Confirm state cleanup after folder completion

### Priority 3: Full EMR Upload
1. **Configuration**: Set 20-minute intervals for full upload
2. **Monitoring**: Set up 38-hour execution oversight
3. **Validation**: Confirm all 114 files uploaded correctly
4. **Cleanup**: Remove state files after successful completion

## Resource Locations

### Documentation
- **Main Guide**: `.scripts\EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`
- **Issue Tracking**: `issues\README.md`
- **Script Errors**: `issues\powershell-script-errors.md`  
- **Testing Results**: `issues\testing-results.md`

### Scripts and State
- **Working Script**: gradual-commit-v3.ps1 (needs syntax fix)
- **Alternative**: gradual-commit-v4.ps1 (needs color fix)
- **State Data**: commit-state-types.json (for resume)
- **Credentials**: .githubinstruct\ (complete setup)

### Repository Access
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Daniel-Gonzalez-AI/fhir-mcp
- **Access**: Private repository  
- **Account**: daniel.agustin.gonzalez.zubillaga@umontreal.ca
- **Status**: 1 EMR file committed, 113 pending

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Script Syntax**: Must be resolved before any progress
- **Time Sensitivity**: Academic project with potential deadlines
- **Data Integrity**: 113 files awaiting upload

### Medium Risk Items  
- **Network Stability**: 38-hour upload requires stable connection
- **GitHub Limits**: Unlikely with 20-minute intervals
- **State Corruption**: Backup state files if needed

### Low Risk Items
- **Authentication**: Working correctly
- **Repository Setup**: Complete and functional
- **File Organization**: EMR structure ready for upload
