# Quick Start Guide for Takeover AI Agent

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### 1. Read These Files First (5 minutes)
```
üìñ PROJECT_HANDOVER.md          # Complete project overview
üêõ issues/git-working-tree-issues.md  # The exact problem to solve
üèÉ EXECUTION_GUIDE.md           # How to run the script
üìä issues/testing-results.md    # What's been tested
```

### 2. Understand the Problem (2 minutes)
- **Working Script**: `.scripts/gradual-commit-v4.ps1` (390 lines)
- **Issue**: Git command `git commit --only` fails when working tree isn't clean
- **Impact**: Blocks upload of 114 EMR files to GitHub
- **Solutions**: 3 detailed proposals already documented

### 3. Test Environment (3 minutes)
```powershell
# Verify PowerShell Core (REQUIRED)
pwsh.exe --version

# Check git access
git status
git push origin main --dry-run

# Test script in safe mode
pwsh.exe -NoProfile -File ".\.scripts\gradual-commit-v4.ps1" -DryRun
```

### 4. Debug and Fix (1-2 hours)
- **Target Function**: `Invoke-FileCommit` (line ~209 in script)
- **Current Command**: `git commit --only "$relativePath"`  
- **Problem**: Fails with dirty working tree
- **Fix**: Choose from 3 proposed solutions in `issues/git-working-tree-issues.md`

### 5. Test Fix (30 minutes)
```powershell
# Test with 2 files only
pwsh.exe -NoProfile -File ".\.scripts\gradual-commit-v4.ps1" -TargetFolder types -IntervalMinutes 1
```

### 6. Production Run (38 hours)
```powershell
# Full upload with 20-minute intervals
pwsh.exe -NoProfile -File ".\.scripts\gradual-commit-v4.ps1" -IntervalMinutes 20
```

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Script completes without errors
- [ ] All 114 EMR files committed individually  
- [ ] Each commit has format: `feat: Add {filename} - EMR {type} (X/114)`
- [ ] Repository shows 114 new commits
- [ ] State file auto-cleaned on completion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES
- **MUST use PowerShell Core** (`pwsh.exe`) not Windows PowerShell
- **Test with subset first** - don't risk 38-hour run on untested fix
- **All analysis done** - focus on implementing one of the 3 proposed solutions
- **Resume capability exists** - script can restart from any point

## üìã PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
1. **Auto-cleanup**: Clean working tree before starting
2. **Alternative git**: Use different git commands  
3. **Simplified approach**: Remove `--only` flag

Choose one, implement, test with subset, then run production.
